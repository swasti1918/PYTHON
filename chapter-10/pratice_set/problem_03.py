#3.Create a class with a class attribute a;
#create an object from it and set ‘a’ directly using ‘object.a = 0’. Does this change the class attribute?

class Demo:
    a = 4

o = Demo()
print(o.a) # Prints the class attribute because instance attribute is not present
o.a = 0 # Instance attribute is set
print(o.a) # Prints the instance attribute because instance attribute is present
print(Demo.a) # Prints the class attribute
